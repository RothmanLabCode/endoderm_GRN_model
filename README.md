# endoderm_GRN_model
Model and fitting code for feed-forward loop model of endoderm development.

*** Recommended to run files in R Studio to keep all plots in one window. ***

endoderm_GRN_model_feedforward.R and endoderm_GRN_model_tier.R are the scripts to run Euler approximations of the system of differential equations, for their respective models, detailed in the manuscript.

fit_endoderm_GRN_model_feedforward.R and fit_endoderm_GRN_model_tier.R are the scripts to fit those respective models to transcriptomics data using a modified Newton-Gauss method following iterative nonlinear least-squares regression.

Instructions for running the programs can be found as comments in the scripts.
