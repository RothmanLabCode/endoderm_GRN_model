# endoderm_GRN_model
Model and fitting code for feed-forward loop model of endoderm development

endoderm_GRN_model.R is the script to run Euler approximations of the system of differential equations detailed in the manuscript.

fit_endoderm_GRN_model.R is the script to fit the model to transcriptomics data using a modified Newton-Gauss method following iterative nonlinear least-squares regression.
